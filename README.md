**File:** `AUCK00NZL_R_20260010000_01D_30S_MO.rnx` |

## 📌 Overview

This project parses a **RINEX 3 GNSS observation file** and focuses on a **single GPS satellite** tracked continuously over a full 24-hour period from the **AUCK00NZL** geodetic reference station in Auckland, New Zealand.

From the raw RINEX data we extract two fundamental observables and visualise them in publication-quality plots:

| Plot | What It Shows |
|------|--------------|
| 📡 Pseudorange Arc | How the receiver-to-satellite distance evolves as the satellite rises, passes overhead, and sets |
| 🌡️ SNR Heatmap | How signal strength varies throughout the tracking arc |

## 🖼️ Output Plots

### Plot 1 — Pseudorange & SNR Time Series

Two-panel figure with a shared time axis:

- **Top panel:** Pseudorange (C1C or C1X) in million metres — the orbital arc of the satellite
- **Bottom panel:** Signal-to-Noise Ratio in dB-Hz — with quality threshold lines at 25, 35, and 40 dB-Hz

### Plot 2 — SNR Heatmap

Single-row heatmap showing the satellite's signal quality over 24 hours using a custom GNSS colour scale:

```
Black        → satellite below horizon (no data)
Blue/Purple  → weak signal (low elevation)
Green        → good signal quality
Yellow/Orange → excellent signal (satellite overhead)
```

## ⚙️ How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Add your RINEX file

Place your RINEX 3 observation file anywhere accessible and update the path in the notebook:

```python
obs_path = "/path/to/your/file.rnx"   # ← update this line in Step 2
```

### 3. Choose your satellite

In **Step 3** of the notebook, change:

```python
SAT = 'G05'   # ← any GPS satellite PRN (G01–G32)
```

### 4. Run all cells

```bash
jupyter notebook project1_single_gps_satellite.ipynb
```
